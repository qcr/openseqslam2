# OpenSeqSLAM2.0 Toolbox

The second release of OpenSeqSLAM, repackaged as an easy to use and configure toolbox for MATLAB.

## Known Bugs (roughly ordered by severity):

* Nil!


## TODO List (roughly ordered by value):

* Add help guidance to guide the user through the UI (everything that can be done must be explained!)
* Add a screen to the Results GUI for comparing to ground truth and generating precision recall curves
* Popup informing that save was successful in Results GUI
* Re-evaluate regex matching scheme for images (in initial configuration GUI)


## Potential Future Feature List (may or may not eventuate...):

* Make the Progress UI correctly display the contrast enhanced difference matrix as an overlay
* Use Git LFS to manage storage of the samples archive
* Make resizable
* Fix axis management (currently a random mess full of unnecessary calls)
* Clean up of messy code areas (break GUI creation and sizing functions into manageable sub-functions, etc.)
