\parbox{\textwidth}{Specific matches can be opened in the focus pane by either clicking in the main plot, or manually selecting in the dropdown list. If clicking the main plot, the match closest to the clicked location will be selected. When a match is selected, its location will be marked in the main plot and the focus pain will show a zoomed in view of the match (which can also show the matched trajectory). The focus pane shows the reference image that was matched to the query image, and the option to open a popup showing the entire sequence of matched images.}
