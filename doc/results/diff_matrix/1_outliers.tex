\parbox{\textwidth}{The outlier fading tool allows the user to enhance the visibility of the best matches in the difference matrix. Outliers are defined as the higher difference values (i.e.\ worst scores) in the matrix. As the slider is moved further to the right, more of the visual colour space is allocated to displaying the lower difference values (at the expense of the outlier difference values).}
