\parbox{\textwidth}{The precision-recall plotting section allows the user to view a precision-recall curve for adjusting the thresholding parameter in a matching method. The parameter which is adjusted is referred to as the \textit{sweep variable}. The sweep variable is $\mu$ when using the windowed uniqueness method, and $\lambda$ when using the basic thresholding method (see relevant menus for their definition). A ground truth must be provided through the associated popup before a precision-recall curve can be constructed.}
