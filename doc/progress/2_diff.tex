\parbox{\textwidth}{Next, every image in the query dataset is compared to every image in the reference dataset to construct a difference matrix. The difference matrix is a graph showing how similar images are to each other. To compare two images, a metric is used to compute a difference score. The toolbox uses a pixel-wise sum of absolute differences (SAD). The difference matrix construction progress is shown in the main window.}
