\parbox{\textwidth}{Next, the contrast enhanced difference matrix is searched for sequence matches. To perform this search, each query image has a list of every possible trajectory for every possible reference image match constructed. From the list of potential matching trajectories, the one with the best score for each query image is noted (and second best outside a window if using the windowed uniqueness method). The window shows the process in searching through all possible trajectories.}
