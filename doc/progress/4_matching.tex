\parbox{\textwidth}{Next, the contrast enhanced difference matrix is searched for sequence matches. To perform this search, each query image has the chosen search method performed for every possible reference image match. From the list of potential matching sequences, the one with the best score for each query image is noted (and second best outside a window if using the windowed uniqueness method). The window shows the process in searching through all possible matching sequences.}
