\indent \textbf{4 --- Enhancing Local Contrast in the Difference Matrix}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{1pt}
\smallskip
\parbox{\textwidth}{Once the difference matrix is computed, local contrast enhancement is performed to improve local matching performance. The matrix is iterated over in a column-wise fashion, match by match, computing a new contrast enhanced difference score. The window shows the progress of the enhancement.}
