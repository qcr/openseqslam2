\parbox{\textwidth}{Ground truth matrices can be specified by selecting a \textit{ground truth velocity} and \textit{ground truth tolerance}. The velocity is the relative speed of the query dataset in comparison to the reference dataset (i.e.\ if the query dataset was traversed twice as quickly, then a velocity of 2 would be appropriate). The angle of declination through the matrix $\theta$ is related to the velocity by $\theta=\arctan{v}$. The tolerance is the acceptable deviation in ground truth that will still be treated as a correct match (i.e.\ a tolerance of 5 means that matching up to 5 frames before, or after, the true ground truth will be treated as a correct match).}
