\centerline{\textbf{\textit{OpenSeqSLAM2.0:} Ground Truth Configuration Popup}}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{2pt}

\parbox{\textwidth}{The ground truth configuration popup allows the user to specify a ground truth between datasets, facilitating the construction of a precision-recall curve for matching performance. A ground truth configuration is a binary matrix, the size of the difference matrix, where values of 1 correspond to correct matches and 0 for incorrect matches. The popup supports three different methods for providing ground truth matrices: 1) explicit velocity models, 2) *.csv files, and 3) *.mat files. The plot in the middle of the popup visualises the ground truth matrix with black corresponding to no match, grey corresponding to treated as a match, and white corresponding to a match.}
