\parbox{\textwidth}{Ground truth matrices can also be loaded from a *.csv datafile. The file is expected to contain a row corresponding to each match, with 3 comma separated values. The first value is the query image number, second value the reference image number, and final value the tolerance window for that match. Files with negative values, image numbers outside the difference matrix range, or more than 3 values a row, will all fail to load.}
