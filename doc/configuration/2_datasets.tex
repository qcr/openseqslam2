\parbox{\textwidth}{Both image and video datasets are supported by the toolbox. Image datasets are expected to be a folder of images with numbering embedded in their filenames, and video datasets are expected to be a supported video file. The \textit{subsample factor} controls how much of the datset is used (i.e.\ every 10th image or video frame).}
\bigskip
\parbox{\textwidth}{Tips: \\ --- Image file names are expected to be of the form \textit{\textless{} prefix \textgreater{} \textless{} number \textgreater{} \textless{} suffix \textgreater{} . \textless{} extension \textgreater{}} (the number should have the same number of digits in all files, and both prefix and suffix can be blank) \\ --- Image files must be in a format supported by MATLAB (run \textit{imformats} in MATLAB to list supported formats) \\ --- Video files must be in a format supported by MATLAB (run \textit{VideoReader.getFileFormats} in MATLAB to list supported formats).}
