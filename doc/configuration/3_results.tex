\parbox{\textwidth}{Results are saved as an *.xml configuration file, and *.mat files representing the data from each stage in the SeqSLAM process (image preprocessing, difference matrix construction, sequence matching). A valid directory must be selected if results are to be automatically stored. Previous results can be opened from this menu, without having to run the whole SeqSLAM process again.}
\bigskip
\parbox{\textwidth}{Tips: \\ --- Results \textbf{will overwrite any existing results} in the directory (once you click start, overwriting will occur without any prompting!) \\ --- You can manually save results later, at the end of the SeqSLAM process \\ --- If you do not wish to save results automatically, leave the box for results save location empty}
