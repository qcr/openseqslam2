\parbox{\textwidth}{The progress UI actively updates the user on the progress the SeqSLAM process. The UI can either be graphical (with visual progress indications), or console (with text-based progress indications). For the graphical version, updates are provided through 3 mechanisms: 1) progression through visual screens representing each step, 2) refreshed visual representations of the progress of the current step, and 3) a percentage representing progress in the current step. The settings here control the update frequency of the last two update mechanisms (the percent value update frequency also applies to the console UI). The update frequency requests that the corresponding visual updates every $n\%$ of progress.}

\parbox{\textwidth}{The user can also control whether a Results GUI appears at the end. If wishing to view results later the user can access them through the first setup GUI when running \textit{OpenSeqSLAM2()}.}
