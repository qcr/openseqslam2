\indent \textbf{Difference Matrix Contrast Enhancement}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{1pt}
\smallskip
\parbox{\textwidth}{The contrast enhancement of the difference matrix aids searching for local best matches (best in local neighborhood),  as opposed to global matches (single best match). To produce a contrast enhanced difference matrix $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$, from a difference matrix $\mathbf{D}$, local means and standard deviations are used (i.e.\ $\tilde{D_l}=\frac{D_l - \overline{D_l}}{\sigma_l}$ where $\overline{D_l}$ is the local mean, and $\sigma_l$ is the local standard deviation). The window width, $R_{window}$ is the number of local difference matrix values used to compute the local statistics.}
