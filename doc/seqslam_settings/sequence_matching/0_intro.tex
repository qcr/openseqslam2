\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{2pt}
\bigskip
\parbox{\textwidth}{Sequence matching is the process that searches within the difference matrix for a sequence of images that best matches the sequence presented by the query dataset. There are 3 different methods for searching through the difference matrix: trajectory-based, cone-based, and hybrid. There are then two different methods for selecting matches from proposals: windowed uniqueness and basic thresholding. This setting screen allows the user to adjust the settings of these operations. More details for the parameters can be found in:}
