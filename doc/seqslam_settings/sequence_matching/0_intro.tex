\parbox{\textwidth}{Sequence matching is the process that searches within the difference matrix for a sequence of images that best matches the sequence presented by the query dataset. The process first looks for the best matching trajectory for each query image, then selects the matches that exceed the chosen match threshold. This setting screen allows the user to adjust the settings of these operations. More details for the parameters can be found in:}
