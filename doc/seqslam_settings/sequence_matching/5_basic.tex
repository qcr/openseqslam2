\parbox{\textwidth}{\textbf{Basic Thresholding:}} \smallskip
\parbox{\textwidth}{The basic thresholding method simply applies a threshold to the scores of each of the best matches to filter out bad matches. Whether smaller or larger scores are better is determined by the search method, so scores above or below the threshold $\lambda$ are selected depending on the search method.}
