\smallskip
\parbox{\textwidth}{Contrast normalisation is done using the inbuilt \textit{localcontrast} method in MATLAB. The \textit{edge threshold} parameter controls the amplitude of strong edges to leave intact, and is a number between 0 and 1. The \textit{enhance strength} specifies the amount of of enhancement to add to the image, and is a number between -1 and 1. For further details run \textit{help localcontrast}.}
