\parbox{\textwidth}{Image preprocessing is done before the SeqSLAM process. The aim is twofold: increase emphasis of image features to aid sequence matching, and reduce complexity to aid performance. The preprocessing process first grayscales the input image, then crops and resizes its contents, before performing a local contrast adjustment to emphasise edges. This setting screen allows the user to adjust the settings of these operations.}
